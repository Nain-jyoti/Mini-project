# Tic-Tac-Toe

The Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using Java and JavaFX is an interactive game that allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid until one player achieves three spaces in a row, column or diagonal, making them the winner. The game features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) designed using JavaFX, allowing players to interact with the game seamlessly.
